	Background:
Working as a full stack developer in a multidisciplinary agile team. Building user-centered RESTful web systems. Working closely with other developers and Webops staff to write code and resolve live issues. Working with designers, user researchers and product managers to ensure high-quality user-centered code is delivered.


Notable work:
* Generating a scheduled multipage spreadsheet for users in PHP and sending this to relevant parties using the Notify API. This involved creating a scheduled AWS task to generate the reports, using a custom database query to identify which individuals needed a report. 
It also involved creating a secondary AWS task to publish the reports. The reports were written in SQL and then generated by PHP, and sent to an internal microservice written to talk to Notify. From here I worked to amend the microservice to send the report to the third party Notify API and therefore the public.
* Identifying excessive timeouts within the live service and moving some user-generated reports to a read only api endpoint. This optimised database capacity and improved performance for other users without adding additional business costs. 
* Creating a header component used across multiple microservices
* Prototyping a new microservice. Refining user requirements for this service. Ensuring this was accessible through Wave testing; improved based on user feedback.
* Handling document upload to a new microservice
* Creating automated/ scheduled letters and tasks for case managers to highlight when cases require work, tasks were created on the system while letters were sent via the Notify Api to the public.
* Creating permissions so staff can delete documents, with a failsafe of 30 days to prevent errors.
