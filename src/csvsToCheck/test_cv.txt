	Background:
I like working as a developer in a multidisciplinary agile team. Build user-centered RESTful web systems.
I work closely with developers and other staff to write lovely code and resolve some issues.
Sometimes I with designers, user researchers and product managers to ensure high-quality user-centered code is delivered.


Notable work:
* Generating a scheduled multipage spreadsheet for users in PHP which looked very nice.
This involved creating a scheduled task to generate the reports, everyone said it was good.
Afterwards I created a secondary AWS task to publish the reports. My favourite reports are made in SQL and use some PHP.

From here I worked to amend the microservice to send the report to the third party Notify API and therefore the public.
* Identifying timeouts in production and fixing this in a difficult way. This meant better database capacity and improved performance without additional business costs.
* Creating new UI component used across many microservices
* Prototyping a new microservice. Refining user requirements for this service.
* Handling document upload to a new microservice
* Creating automated tasks for case managers, these tasks were created on the system. I also automated letters via the Notify Api.
* New permissions were made so staff can delete documents, (with a failsafe of 30 days to prevent errors).
