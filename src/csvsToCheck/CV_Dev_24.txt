Employment History:
Developer: 
May 23 - Present. Ministry of Justice - Digital and Technology.
	

	

	Skills:
	Background:
Working as a full stack developer in a multidisciplinary agile team. Building user-centered RESTful web systems. Working closely with other developers and Webops staff to write code and resolve live issues. Working with designers, user researchers and product managers to ensure high-quality user-centered code is delivered.


Notable work:
* Generating a scheduled multipage spreadsheet for users in PHP and sending this to relevant parties using the Notify API. This involved creating a scheduled AWS task to generate the reports, using a custom database query to identify which individuals needed a report. 
It also involved creating a secondary AWS task to publish the reports. The reports were written in SQL and then generated by PHP, and sent to an internal microservice written to talk to Notify. From here I worked to amend the microservice to send the report to the third party Notify API and therefore the public.
* Identifying excessive timeouts within the live service and moving some user-generated reports to a read only api endpoint. This optimised database capacity and improved performance for other users without adding additional business costs. 
* Creating a header component used across multiple microservices
* Prototyping a new microservice. Refining user requirements for this service. Ensuring this was accessible through Wave testing; improved based on user feedback.
* Handling document upload to a new microservice
* Creating automated/ scheduled letters and tasks for case managers to highlight when cases require work, tasks were created on the system while letters were sent via the Notify Api to the public.
* Creating permissions so staff can delete documents, with a failsafe of 30 days to prevent errors.


Responsibilities:
   * Ensuring service availability: Working in AWS to monitor and resolve reported bugs. Raising tickets to fix non urgent issues or creating PRs to immediately resolve critical issues. Ensuring we’re meeting business needs. 
   * Writing automated tests as part of all tickets to ensure robust system design.
   * User focus: Attend user feedback sessions, a roadshow and user requirement meetings to help improve the existing services and champion user needs within work. This helps me consider all aspects of user interaction with UI during ticket refinement to minimise future bugs or unexpected input. 
   * Ensuring quality, secure code is deployed by myself and others that meets security guidelines and OWASP standards. 
   * Prototyping new microservices (Lay Deputy Hub), including liaising with users, product managers and designers to ensure accessible and functional design.
   * Pair programming/ coaching with Junior members of the team to help them learn the fundamentals of coding. Helping identify areas to help them develop further (e.g. supportive readings to consolidate learning or exercises for them to continue in L&D if desired). 
   * Pair programming / collaborating with other developers of varying levels to share skills and knowledge around certain areas of the codebase (knowledge sharing)

Junior Developer: 
April 21 - May 23. Ministry of Justice - Digital and Technology.
	

	Notable work:
   * Creating a new microservice that integrated with an existing legacy system and database. Designing for accessibility with GDS components, user centric design and Pa11y accessibility testing. This microservices was able to be deployed/ managed separately to the rest of the service but communicated with it. 
   * Create a new search endpoint to only return one type of person from our database. This involved amending an elastic search microservice that was built in house and creating new database queries and APIs. Improved user experience of the service and time taken to complete their tasks.
   * Creating a reusable script for regularly repeated business database updated requests, saving developers time and allowing them to query the github version history for previous queries.
   * Generating new reports for users with complex SQL queries.
   * Rewriting service and microservice UI tests into Cypress
